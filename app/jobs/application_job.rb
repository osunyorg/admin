    perform_throttle: [100, 1.hour],

    # Note: Under heavy load, the total number of jobs may exceed the
    # sum of `enqueue_limit` and `perform_limit` because of race conditions
    # caused by imperfectly disjunctive states. If you need to constrain
    # the total number of jobs, use `total_limit` instead. See #378.

    # Can be String or Lambda/Proc that is invoked in the context of the job.
    #
    # If a key is not provided GoodJob will use the job class name.
    #
    # To disable concurrency control, for example in a subclass, set the
    # key explicitly to nil (e.g. `key: nil` or `key: -> { nil }`)
    #
    # If you provide a custom concurrency key (for example, if concurrency is supposed
    # to be controlled by the first job argument) make sure that it is sufficiently unique across
    # jobs and queues by adding the job class or queue to the key yourself, if needed.
    #
    # Note: When using a model instance as part of your custom concurrency key, make sure
    # to explicitly use its `id` or `to_global_id` because otherwise it will not stringify as expected.
    #
    # Note: Arguments passed to #perform_later can be accessed through Active Job's `arguments` method
    # which is an array containing positional arguments and, optionally, a kwarg hash.
