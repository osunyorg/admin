      text: Scientific research is both an approach that creates knowledge motivated by pure curiosity and an activity that generates innovations that increase the means of action and diagnosis on nature, man and society. These two aspects of research, fundamental and applied, far from opposing each other, complement each other. Fundamental research creates the knowledge base from which applications are born and, conversely, technological advances provide the increasingly sophisticated investigative tools that lead to a deepening of our fundamental knowledge.
